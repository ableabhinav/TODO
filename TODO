Things to learn:
dmseg, cat, dpkg


git:

Working directory -> Staging Area -> Repository


Working Directory:
Where my actual code is

Staging area:
Here I can save checkpoints & compare with my working directory

Repository:
If all goes well, I actually commit the change/permanently store changes to my repo with a changelog/message or else I
roll back

Learnt important concepts like git init, config username and email as its a DVCS, Create staging area (add: See changes), repor (commit: with message, save changes to your main repo).

staging area: My own changelog
Repo: Save final changes
